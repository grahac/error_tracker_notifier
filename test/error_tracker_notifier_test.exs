  # Additional tests would be added to test the following scenarios:
  # 1. Test that telemetry handlers are properly attached
  # 2. Test that error notifications are properly formatted and sent
  # 3. Test that occurrence notifications are properly formatted and sent
  # 4. Test that configuration is properly loaded
  # These tests would require mocking the ErrorTracker and Swoosh dependencies.
